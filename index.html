                        The name "bubble sort" was first used by Kenneth E.
                        Iverson in his book 'A Programming Language' in 1962.
                        Iverson was a Canadian computer scientist known for his
                        contributions to programming language like APL which
                        paved the way for other programming languages.However, it is important to note that it 
                        became official by <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bubble/bubble-pres.pdf" target="_blank">C.J. Shaw and T. N. Trimble in 'Algorithm 75'(pg. 9)</a> and was 
                        originally called shuttle sort. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Bubble sort is an sorting algorithm that works through
                        comparison. The algorithm repeatedly iterates through
                        the list swapping elements that are out of order. Items
                        continually 'bubble up' to their respective positions,
                        hence the name bubble sort.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Bubble sort is not implemented in real world scenarios,
                        since its performance abismal as inputs grows. Instead,
                        bubble sort is used as an introduction to algorithms in
                        educational settings because of its simplicity and
                        intuitiveness.

                The performance and efficiency can be measured through the
                number of operations an algorithm does in order to accomplish a
                particular task, or in other words its run time complexity. By
                counting the number of operations instead of execution time,
                factors like hardware and software(which may vary are excluded).
                In particular, how good an algorithm is, is measured mainly by
                two things. The first being, the relationship between the input
                size and number of operations required. For instance, does the
                number of operations increase exponentially, linearly, or
                logarithmically as the input size grows? Moreover, since
                algorithms perform best with certain kinds of inputs, the worst
                case scenario is the second criteria used to determine algorithm
                perfomance.

                Searching, sorting, and ordering a list of things or information
                is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science.
                Sorting is a key data structure function that simplifies these
                difficult processes and aids in searching and organizing data.

                In order to measure the performace algorithms the Big-Oh
                notation has been adopted as a means to understand the numbers
                of operations and algorithm does as the input size grows. More
                formally, Big-Oh is defined as:
                <blockquote cite="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bigOnotation.html">
                  <i> f(n) = O(g(n)) means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ k. The values of c and k must be fixed for the function f and must not depend on n.</i>
                </blockquote>

                The subject of this project is bubble sort. From an When compared to other 
                sorting algorithms such as quicksort, bubble sort is extremely sluggish, having a 
                worst-case complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). On the other hand, it's one of the most straightforward
                sorting algorithms to understand and write from scratch. 
              </p>
              <img src="images/bbsort-math-equation.png" style="width: 90%" />
              <p style="margin-top: 20px">
              As shown above, due to its nested for loop structure, bubble sort has a worst  
              and average runtime complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). O(n<sup>2</sup>) is a very bad 
              runtime complexity in comparison to sorting algorithms like 
              quicksort which have a logarithmic runtime. 
              A significant advantage that bubble sort has over most other
              algorithms(except insertion sort) is the ability to detect if 
              list is sorted is built into the algorithm
              </p>
              <p>
                The most straightforward reason for analyzing an algorithm 
                is to discover its characteristics in order to evaluate its 
                suitability for various applications or compare it with other 
                algorithms for the same application. Moreover, the analysis of 
                an algorithm can help us understand it better, and can suggest 
                informed improvements. Algorithms tend to become shorter, simpler, 
                and more elegant during the analysis process.

              <h3><i>What is the advantage of using bubble sort?</i></h3>
              <p>
                One of the main advantages of a bubble sort is that 
                it is a very simple algorithm to describe to a computer. 
                There is only really one task to perform (compare two values
                 and, if needed, swap them). This makes for a very small and
                  simple computer program .
              </p>


              <h3><i>What is the main disadvantage of bubble sort?</i></h3>
              <p>
                The main disadvantage of the bubble sort method is the time it requires.
                With a running time of O(n^2), it is highly inefficient for large data
                sets.

                Although, there are only three algorithmn versions, there other
                features involved in this project such as reading and writing
                from files as well as genarating random lists of arbitrary
                sizes. These different parts need to integrate seemlessly and be
                readable and in order to do so, the program have been
                divided into three parts. Each part contains classes that have
                narrowed responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first of these parts is the utilites, which are classes that
                are not directly tied to the algorithm but are essential to the
                overall project. This section includes a class responsible for
                reading and writing from the input and output files respectively
                and a class that takes care of generating random list(input can
                be given from the input file or list generator). The second
                section includes the structural classes like the parent class
                of the algorithms and interface. These classes are meant to
                introduce and enforce object oriented programming principles
                like reusability and access restriction. Lastly, there is the
                algorithms classes that simply implement the different versions
                of the algorithm. And of course the Main class that is
                responsible for tying these components together.

                  Not the best sorting algorithm, but it implements very simple
                  features for sorting, along with some fundamental iteration
                  techniques. Overall a very simplistic program.

                The key takeaway from this project is that algorithmns can come
                in a variety of forms, but they can be optimized in order to
                achieve better overall performance. Moreover, tradeoffs like
                memory usage and speed will need to be made in order to achieve
                better efficiency in most cases. In this case, in order to
                achieve better average perfomance(not improving worst time
                case), a variable was used to check the state and reducew
                wasteful iterations.

                This project was very fun to work on taught us many different
                things. From measuring performance of algorithms to presenting
                our findings, we realized there are many parts involved in
                designing and analysing algorithms. Furthermore, we couldn't
                help but wonder about algorithmns in bigger stages where the
                input sizes range in the millions and other unfathomable
                discrepancies may come up.
